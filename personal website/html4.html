            <h3>My experience</h3>
            <p>
               I've  always like vedio games, but as a player, I don't care how it was made. 
               When I see the Game Jam,which is one of the most big event about amateur game developing, I realized that the game developing is touchable.
               So i began been interest in programing. The wonderful and complex games can be made by many lines of codes, what a mirical!
               That's why i am interest in computer sciens.

            <h3>About Game Jam</h3>
            <p>
                A game jam is an event where participants try to make a video game from scratch.[1] Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams.
                The event duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours. Participants are generally programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and others in game development-related fields.[2]
                While many game jams are run purely as a game-making exercise, some game jams are contests that offer prizes.
